        Boy don't you know you can't escape me
        Oh darlin' 'cause you'll always be my baby
        And we'll linger on
        Time can't erase a feelin' this strong
        No way you're never gonna shake me
        Oh darlin' 'cause you'll always be my baby
        I know that you'll be back boy
        When your days and your nights get a little bit colder oh
        (I know that)
        You'll be right back, baby
        Oh baby believe me it's only a matter of time, time
        You'll always be apart of me
        I'm part of you indefinitely
        Boy don't you know you can't escape me
        Oh darlin' 'cause you'll always be my baby
        And we'll linger on
        Time can't erase a feelin' this strong
        No way you're never gonna shake me
        Ooh darlin' 'cause you'll always be my baby
        You'll always be a part of me
        I'm part of you indefinitely
        Boy don't you know you can't escape me, yeah
        Oh darlin' 'cause you'll always be my baby
        And we'll linger on
        (You and I will always be)
        Time can't erase a feelin' this strong
        (You and I)
        No way you're never gonna shake me
        (You and I)
        Ooh darlin' 'cause you'll always be my baby
        (You and I)
